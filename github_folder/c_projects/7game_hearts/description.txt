Project card game 'hearts'

The goal of this project is to imitate the classic card game Hearts, using only algorithms and logic without a graphical user interface. The game involves four players, with one human player and three computer-controlled players. The objective is to acquire the fewest points possible, with each player who reaches 100 points being eliminated from the game. The player who remains at the end is declared the winner.

In Hearts, each heart card is worth one point, while the queen of spades is worth 13 points. All other cards have no point value.

The dealer shuffles a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers), and each player is dealt 13 cards.

Before the first trick is played, each player selects three cards to pass to their opponent. In the first round, players pass to the opponent on their left, in the second round to the opponent on their right, and in the third round to the opponent across from them. In the fourth round, no cards are passed. This process repeats in subsequent rounds, with players passing to the opponent on their left.

The player with the 2 of clubs starts the first trick. This card is known as the leading card, and subsequent players must follow suit if possible. Then the turnw are clockwise from him. If a player does not have a card from the leading suit, they may play any card they choose. The player with the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick and takes all the cards played in that trick. If a player does not have a card from the leading suit and plays the highest card of a different suit, that card does not count and the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick.
